## 👀 What Is a Wallhack in Squad?

A **wallhack** is a visual ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) tool that lets you **see enemies, vehicles, FOBs, mines, and more through solid surfaces** like buildings, hills, and terrain.

In Squad, where every corner can be a death trap and comms matter more than reflexes, this cheat removes all uncertainty. **No more guessing, no more surprise attacks — you see it all.**
